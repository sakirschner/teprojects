# Module 2 Capstone - National Park Campsite Reservation  Congratulations! You did such a great job on your previous application we want you to build our new campsite reservation application. We are tasking you to build a command line driven application that our National Park Service can use to book campsite reservations.  
 
The requirements for your application are listed below: 
 
1. As a user of the system, I need the ability to view a list of the available parks in the system, sorted alphabetically by name.  
 
a. A park includes an id, name, location, established date, area, annual visitor count, and description. 
 
2. As a user of the system, I need the ability to select a park that my customer is visiting and see a list of all campgrounds for that available park.  
 
a. A campground includes an id, name, open month, closing month, and a daily fee. 
 
3. As a user of the system, I need the ability to select a campground and search for date availability so that I can make a reservation. 
 
a. A reservation search only requires the desired campground, a start date, and an end date. 
 
b. A campsite is unavailable if any part of their preferred date range overlaps with an existing reservation. 
 
c. If no campsites are available, indicate to the user that there are no available sites and ask them if they would like to enter in an alternate date range. 
 
d. The TOP 5 available campsites should be displayed along with the cost for the total stay. 

4. As a user of the system, once I find a campsite that is open during the time window I am looking for, I need the ability to book a reservation at a selected campsite. 
 
a. A reservation requires a name to reserve under, a start date, and an end date. 
 
b. A confirmation id is presented to the user once the reservation has been submitted.
